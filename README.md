# Hardware for Neural Networks (2017 Edition)

I was just curious about current hardware options for neural networks and ended up giving a talk. 

Brief affair with LaTex and Beamer - passion still strong after all those years :-)

* Is GPU really faster? (How much?)
* Which parameter is important for performance?
* Why is only NVidia ever mentioned as an option?
* Is there anything interesting expected for 2017?

Hopefully no one mind me using all those images from web. If so please contact me.
